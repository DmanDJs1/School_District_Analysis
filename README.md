# Intro

It has come to our attention that we had some dishonest students at Thomas High School that might have skewed the overall results for the entire school discrict. If this is true, it could have a huge overall impact on our analysis when comparing to other schools. We have been asked by Maria to do some analytical investigating to determine the impact of the alledge cheating.


## Overview of the challenge

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor to have the students’ grades be reanalyze specifically the reading and math grades for Thomas High School on suspicion of potential misconduct. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to us for help. Maria, our client has asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once complete, she has asked us to repeat the school district analysis and determine how the changes have affected the overall school performance.

## District Summary 

As a result of removing the potentially tainted score of Thomas High School’s math and reading scores, the district summary results were as follows:
- The average math scores decreased from 79% to 78.9%
- The average reading scores did not have any impact displaying no change.
- The (%) Percent passing Math did decrease from 75% to 74%.
- The (%) Percent passing Reading did decrease from 86% to 85%.
- The (%) Percent Overall Passing decreased from 65% to 64%. 

## Summary

As a result of the updated data, we have been able to detect differences when we removed the reading and math scores from Thomas High School. When we replaced the scores for Thomas High School, we saw their overall ranking drop among all the schools reviewed. Secondly, because the 9th and 10th grader scores being replaced, the overall average scores for the district were significant which caused a negative impact on the charter schools. Despite the controversy Thomas High School still managed to have a strong average math and reading score.
